# Significant Contributions

**Darren White** for his pre-input, ongoing code support with the code and then his extensive support in helping me get the Control portions of this module down from 10 minutes to 25 seconds per 2500 PCs. You are definitely a legend, Darren.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to a number of people whose help (and in certain cases code) I have used within this project

**Chris Taylor** where I have re-used and modified certain parts of the ConnectWise Control module to send commands to Control and his ConnectWise Automate module so we can reinstall services

**Mendy Green** for helping me test the initial code

**Davíð Snædal** for his assistance before this module even started with guidance on connection to the Automate REST APIs

**ConnectWise** for absolutely smashing the delivery of their API
